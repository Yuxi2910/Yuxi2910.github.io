## Project Overview
[A cloudburst is a sudden, intense rainfall event that can lead to severe flooding and devastation. These extreme weather events are becoming more frequent due to factors such as global warming. Hence, it is important to predict forecoming cloudburst with high accuracy and within a short time limit. This project, corporated by the QMSS Practicum team and Alt Surya Inc., aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts cloudbursts within a 4 to 6 hours window.]
